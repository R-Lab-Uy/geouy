## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.
* More clearly identified the roles in the DESCRIPTION
* Put the cran-comments.md in .Rbuildignore
* And add \dontrun{} to the examples for the elapsed time notes

* Windows 7 Professional (x64), R 3.4.3
* Rhub
  * Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC
